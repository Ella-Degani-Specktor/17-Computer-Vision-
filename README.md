# Computer Vision
The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. 
The project is to build and evaluate a model for verifying people's age, keeping the following in mind:
- Shops are equipped with cameras in checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol.
- Computer vision methods can be used to determine age of a person from a photo.
- We have a set of photographs of people with their ages indicated.
